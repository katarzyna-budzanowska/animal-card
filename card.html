				They have limited control over movement, but can use their hydrostatic skeleton to navigate through contraction-pulsations of the bell-like body; some species actively swim most of the time, while others are mostly passive.

					Jellyfish are softbodied, free-swimming aquatic animals with a gelatinous umbrella-shaped bell and trailing tentacles which may be utilized to capture prey or defend against predators by emitting toxins in a painful sting. This species is found in every ocean, from the surface to the deep sea. Jellyfish have roamed the seas for at least 500 million years, and possibly 700 million years or more, making them the oldest multi-organ animal.
